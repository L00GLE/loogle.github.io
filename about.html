		Following the mundane routine of university, I became bored and made the decision to take a
		break and reignite my creative curiosity. I took a year off from college and discovered my new interest in
		the Python programming language. After following through some books, video tutorials, and mentoring from a
		relative whose career is in software development, I knew that this is something I enjoy as a hobby and would
		likely enjoy as a profession. I seek to develop my skills as a problem solver as efficiently and practical as
		possible for the betterment of myself and possibly some part of the world. This website is a
		small demonstration of my technical journey so far.
